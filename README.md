# Face-Mask-Detection-Using-Machine-Learning
Abstract:

After the Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) case spread rapidly in the world, the World Health Organization (WHO) confirmed that this is a dangerous virus which can be spread from human to human through droplets and airborne. As for prevention, I would like you to wear a face mask outside or meet others. However, some irresponsible people refuse to wear face masks with so many excuses. Moreover, developing the face mask detector is very crucial in this case. This project aims to create a face mask detector that can detect any face mask. To detect the face mask, MobileNetV2 SSD(Single Shot multi-box Detector) is used which works well in detecting the object in real-time. A massive number of face images are used in this project for training the data. The experimental results have been achieved using real-time applications. The real-time images are tested to accurately detect the people who wear or do not wear the face mask based on the face angle.



This dataset consists of 1,376 images belonging to two classes:

•	 with_mask: 690 images

•	 without_mask: 686 images


Model Trained for 20 Epochs:
